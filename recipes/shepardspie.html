                <li>50g parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add the oil to a large skillet and place it over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add the onions. Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Add the ground beef (or ground lamb) to the skillet and break it apart with a wooden spoon. Add the parsley, rosemary, thyme, salt, and and pepper. Stir well. Cook for 6-8 minutes, until the meat is browned, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Add the Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Add the flour and tomato paste. Stir until well incorporated and no clumps of tomato paste remain.</li>
                    <li>Add the broth, frozen peas and carrots, and frozen corn. Bring the liquid to a boil then reduce to simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Set the meat mixture aside. Preheat oven to 200 Degree C.</li>
                    <li>Drain the potatoes in a colander. Return the potatoes to the hot pot. Let the potatoes rest in the hot pot for 1 minute to evaporate any remaining liquid.</li>
                    <li>Add butter, half & half, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mash the potatoes and stir until all the ingredients are mixed together.</li>
                    <li>Add the parmesan cheese to the potatoes. Stir until well combined.</li>
                    <li>Pour the meat mixture into a 170x270cm baking dish. Spread it out into an even layer. Spoon the mashed potatoes on top of the meat. Carefully spread into an even layer.</li>
                    <li>If the baking dish looks very full, place it on a rimmed baking sheet so that the filling doesn't bubble over into your oven. Bake uncovered for 25-30 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
                </ol>
